## Code Readiness
- [ ] All development-only code/comments removed or conditionally rendered

## Supabase Configuration
- [ ] Authentication redirect URLs prepared (to be updated after deployment)
- [ ] CORS configuration ready to be updated with Vercel domain

## Pre-deployment Local Testing
- [ ] Application builds successfully with `npm run build`
- [ ] Production build works locally with `npm run preview`
- [ ] Authentication flow works in the production build
- [ ] All CRUD operations work in the production build
- [ ] File uploads and resource sharing functioning correctly

## GitHub Repository Status
